Snake Game üêç


This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, collects food to grow, and keeps track of the score. The objective is to collect as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

Features

Responsive Snake Movement: The snake moves up, down, left, or right based on the player's input.
Food Collection: The snake grows and the score increases whenever it eats the food.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with its own tail.
Scoreboard: Displays the current score at the top of the screen.

How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Collect the food (blue circle) to grow the snake and increase your score.
Avoid running into the walls or your own tail. If this happens, the game will display "GAME OVER."
